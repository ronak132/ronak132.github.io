### Hobbies
I like to read. This blog is my favorite in [cricket](http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/blogs/index.html?genre=442)

This is a good page to read about random stuff [Wikipedia:unusual articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Unusual_articles)

I play cricket and table tennis sometimes. I watch cricket, tennis, badminton. I want to meet P V Sindhu and Maria Sharapova one day.

My favorite cricketers are Shane Warne(The best captain Australia chose not to have), Wasim Akram(who made the ball walk and talk like no-one did), Rahul Dravid(Probably the last classicial test bastman).

I feel Virat Kohli is better than Sachin Tendulkar(I can hear some knives being sharpened, but that's just my opinion. When Kohli bats in limited-overs cricket, he whispers into my ear: I've got this. Whatever the situation, whatever my form, however hot the opposition are: I've got this.). Pranay Sankhlecha thinks so too in this [article](http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/986665.html)

Usain Bolt is the greatest olympian ever(not Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz, Jesse Owens, Nadia ComÄƒneci, Bob Beamon, Carl Lewis). His record in 100m and 200m will be intact till 2040 easily.

I am interested in railways, how they function and operate. I won a national level Railway quiz on [IndiaRailInfo](https://indiarailinfo.com/) in Oct, 2012.
